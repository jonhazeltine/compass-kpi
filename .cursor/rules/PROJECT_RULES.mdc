# Project Rules

Before proposing or making any changes, consult:
- `/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `/architecture/NON_NEGOTIABLES.md`
- `/architecture/CURRENT_SPRINT.md`

Mandatory behavior:
1. Do not violate `/architecture/NON_NEGOTIABLES.md`.
2. If a request conflicts with non-negotiables, stop and propose compliant alternatives.
3. If work is outside `/architecture/CURRENT_SPRINT.md`, stop and request explicit approval.
4. If structural changes are made (folders, schema, API boundaries), update `/architecture/DECISIONS_LOG.md` in the same change set.
5. Prefer concise, readable docs and practical implementation.
