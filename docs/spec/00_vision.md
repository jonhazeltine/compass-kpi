# 00 Vision

## Problem Statement
Real estate agents and team leaders need a single system to track leading activity, forecast near-term production, and compare projections against realized outcomes without mixing those concepts. Compass KPI solves this with KPI logging, forecasted PC, actual GCI tracking, team challenges, and coaching-oriented feedback.

## Product Direction
- Make performance tracking fast enough for daily use.
- Keep forecasting understandable and auditable.
- Use challenge mechanics to increase consistency of high-value behaviors.
- Support both individual and team workflows with role-based access.

## Primary Users
- Individual Agent
- Team Member
- Team Leader
- Super Admin (operations + catalog + analytics)

## Core Value Propositions
- Translate daily activity into projected production (PC) with transparent rules.
- Keep Actual GCI and Deals Closed visible as realized outcomes.
- Improve decision-making through Forecast Confidence overlays.
- Drive accountability with challenge participation and leaderboard context.

## Success Metrics (Initial)
- Daily/weekly active logging rate.
- 30-day retention of active users.
- Challenge join and completion rates.
- Forecast usage (views/interactions with PC + confidence layer).
- Reduction in "no activity" stretches that trigger GP/VP decay.

## Non-Negotiable Alignment
- PC and Actual GCI are modeled and displayed separately.
- GP/VP do not generate PC.
- Forecast Confidence affects display/interpretation, not base PC values.
- Pipeline Anchors are required forecasting inputs.
