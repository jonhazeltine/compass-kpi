# Intended Persona Flow Screenmap (Figma-First)

## Purpose
Create a single reference for what the app is intended to contain, organized by **persona** and **flow**, using Figma as the primary source of truth.

This document is the planning/control-plane companion to:
- `/Users/jon/compass-kpi/docs/spec/appendix/FIGMA_BUILD_MAPPING.md`
- `/Users/jon/compass-kpi/design/figma/FIGMA_INDEX.md`

Use this for:
- worker prompt scoping (`persona + flow + screen`)
- implementation sequencing
- gap tracking (`implemented` vs `stub` vs `missing`)
- avoiding guessed UI work

## Organizing Model (Required)
We do **not** treat Team Leader / Team Member / Solo User as separate apps.

We use:
1. **Shared product flows** (Onboarding, Dashboard/KPI, Challenge, Team, Profile, Settings/Payment)
2. **Persona variants / access** (Solo User, Team Member, Team Leader)

This allows one canonical screen target per destination, with persona-specific deltas tracked explicitly.

## Status Legend
- `implemented`: screen exists and is functional in runtime
- `partial`: screen/flow exists but not at intended parity or missing behavior
- `stub`: navigable placeholder/shell exists
- `missing`: not implemented in runtime

## Personas
- `Solo User`
- `Team Member`
- `Team Leader`

## Canonical Shared Flows
- `onboarding`
- `dashboard_kpi`
- `challenge`
- `team`
- `profile`
- `settings_payment`

## Current Priority Rule (Controller)
Current forward-progress priority:
1. `Team Leader / team` flow parity (dashboard + management screens)
2. `Team Member / challenge+team participation` parity
3. `Solo User / challenge` parity tightening
4. cross-persona reconciliation

## Figma Canonical References (currently locked for active Team work)
- `team_dashboard`: node `173-29934` (corrected canonical; prior `388-8814` was a profile screen mismatch)
- `team_invite_member`: node `173-4448`
- `team_pending_invitations`: node `173-4612`
- `team_kpi_settings`: node `173-4531`
- `team_pipeline`: node `168-16300`
- `team_single_person_challenges`: node `173-4905`

## Shared Runtime Router Map (Current Implementation Anchor)
Use this to map intended screens to current code constraints.

### App shell
- `/Users/jon/compass-kpi/app/App.tsx`
  - unauthenticated -> `AuthFlowScreen`
  - authenticated member -> `HomeScreen`
  - authenticated admin web -> `AdminShellScreen`

### Member shell
- `/Users/jon/compass-kpi/app/screens/HomeScreen.tsx`
  - `KPIDashboardScreen`
  - `ProfileSettingsScreen`

### KPI Dashboard internal routers
- `/Users/jon/compass-kpi/app/screens/KPIDashboardScreen.tsx`
  - bottom tabs: `home`, `challenge`, `newkpi`, `team`, `user(coming next)`
  - challenge subflow: `list`, `details`, `leaderboard`
  - team subflow: `dashboard`, `invite_member`, `pending_invitations`, `kpi_settings`, `pipeline`, `team_challenges`

## Forward Progress Build Order (Controller)
1. Team Leader `team.dashboard` parity + route wiring (`Chunk A`)
2. Team Leader `team.invite_member` + `team.pending_invitations`
3. Team Leader `team.kpi_settings` + `team.pipeline`
4. Team Leader `team.team_challenges`
5. Team Member perspective deltas on Team/Challenge surfaces
6. Solo User challenge parity pass
7. Cross-persona cleanup/reconciliation

## Prompting Rule (for all future workers)
Every implementation prompt must identify:
- Persona
- Flow
- Screen(s)
- Canonical Figma node IDs + export filenames
- Expected wiring transitions
- Out-of-scope personas/flows

Do not assign work as generic “polish Team” or “fix challenge screen.”
